# Hello, Battleship!

I've been wanting to do this project for a long time. And finally, as of 03/01/2024, I've finally gotten around to start doing it!

(Disclaimer: this project is not finished yet).

## What's this about?

Well, this is a game where you play single-player battleship. Instead of the usual guess-where-your-opponents-ships-are, the ships will be hidden from you and you have to guess where the hidden ships are with the least number of guesses possible.
