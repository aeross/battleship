# Hello, Battleship!

I've been wanting to do this project for a long time. And finally, as of 03/01/2024, I've finally gotten around to start doing it!

## What's this about?

Well, this is a game where you play battleship against a bot. That's it.

The whole game algorithms and logic are made with zero dependencies. With this project, I aim to gain a deeper understanding about Spring Boot, as well as the Java programming language itself, including object-oriented design. Additionally, it also helps me to improve my problem solving skills as those are one of the most essential skills a developer should have.

## Tech Stack

- Server: REST API with Java and Spring Boot
- Client: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, React
